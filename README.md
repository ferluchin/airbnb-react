# Airbnb Experiences.

This is a simple Airbnb Experiences clone built using React. The app showcases a list of experiences that users can browse.

Check the live demo here: [Airbnb Experience Preview](https://airbnb2-experience.netlify.app)

## What I've Learned

* __Setting Up Projects:__ I've learned how to properly structure a React application and how to create a new project using Create React App.

* __Reusable Components:__ I've gained more understanding of how to create reusable components, which promotes code efficiency and reusability.

* __Props Understanding:__ I've learned how to pass data from parent components to child components through props. I've also learned how to use the data passed as props in the child components.

* __Rendering Arrays:__ I've understood how to render arrays in React by using the map() function. It allowed me to create a list of components.

* **Mapping Data Into Components:** I've learned how to use the map() function to create new components based on data stored in arrays.

* **Passing Objects as Props:** I've learned how to pass whole objects as props and how to use them in child components.

* **Spreading Objects as Props**: I've learned how to use the spread operator to pass props to components, which makes the component cleaner and easier to understand.
